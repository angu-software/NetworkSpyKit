  s.description      = <<-DESC
`NetworkSpyKit` is a lightweight, thread-safe HTTP spy and stub tool for testing code that performs network requests in Swift.

It allows you to:
- Record outgoing `URLRequest`s
- Return predefined or dynamic stubbed responses
- Assert request behavior without hitting the real network
- Keep your tests fast, isolated, and deterministic
